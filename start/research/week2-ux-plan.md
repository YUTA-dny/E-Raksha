# Week 2 UI/UX Design Plan

**Day 1 (Mon):** Review all wireframes, sketch low-fidelity flows, define key interactions.  
**Day 2 (Tue):** Apply accessibility standards (WCAG 4.5:1, large targets), add voice feedback/labels.  
**Day 3 (Wed):** Peer usability tests, iterate wireframes based on feedback.  
**Day 4 (Thu):** Refine icons, finalize layouts/interactions, build Figma clickable prototype.  
**Day 5 (Fri):** Apply “crisis UX” guidelines: min user steps, confirmatory language, color coding, error handling.

**Principles:**

- Emergency = clarity first, minimum steps, clear feedback.
- Accessibility always: alt text, font scaling, screen reader and touch.
- “Reduce Panic”: All flows are short, visual & audio confirmations.
