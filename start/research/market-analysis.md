# Market Analysis

## Existing Apps (India)

- 112 India App: Government multi-agency emergency app.
- State police apps (Himmat, Raksha, etc.), but inconsistent UX.
- My Safetipin: Crowd-sourced safety auditing.
- Most are not voice-activated; many lack proper accessibility or regionwise numbers.

## Market Gaps

- Cumbersome app flows, cluttered UI, non-inclusive language.
- Poor suitability for panic and for users with disabilities (vision/motor).
- Inadequate regional/language adaptation, little always-on background help.

## Opportunity

- Voice/gesture activation, true PWA installability, silent/stealth options, bigger focus on accessibility.
